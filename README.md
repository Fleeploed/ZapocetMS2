# Restaurant application
A restaurant application where you can add and edit ingredients, recipe, dish category.
There are three forms: ingredients, menu, dish.
In the form ingredients, the user can add available ingredients to the database as well as delete them.
In the form menu, the user can add, delete a category or a dish.
The dish form displays the ingredient, recipe and weight of the dish available in the database.
I use C# and MySQL database.
